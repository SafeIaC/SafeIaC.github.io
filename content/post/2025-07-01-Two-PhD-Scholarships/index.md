Are you interested in building more reliable DevOps systems? As part of SafeIaC, we have **two fully-funded PhD positions** available at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods, focused on improving the reliability of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Policy as Code (PaC).
<!--more-->

- One project will focus on the analysis and detection of issues in IaC
- The other will tackle the automated repair of IaC using cutting-edge techniques

You'll collaborate with the [SafeIaC team](/people) and you'll be part of the [Software Reliability Lab](https://sr-lab.github.io), an active research team working on real-world problems in close collaboration with industry partners like Amazon Web Services and Checkmarx, ensuring that your research has direct, practical impact.

If you're excited by the idea of combining AI and software verification to make DevOps infrastructure safer and smarter, we'd love to hear from you.
